# Combinator

A small site built using FastAPI and React that returns all the combos in your Magic: The Gathering Commander/EDH deck.

Combo data is retrieved from the wonderful [Commander Spellbook](https://commanderspellbook.com/)

You can find the site at [mtgcombinator.com](https://mtgcombinator.com/)

## TODO:

**Frontend**:   
- [ ] Create refresh cache invalidation button to let users opt out of caching
- [ ] Fix card search
- [ ] Slider for card image size?
- [ ] Find more than 50 moxfield decks
- [ ] Combo hiding? (to show only relevant ones for a second? solved by filter?)
